# Melody_In_Clouds

### Project Overview:
Melody in Cloud is an End-to-End ETL pipeline project leveraging AWS cloud services. Real-time Spotify data is fetched using the Spotify developer API and loaded into a Snowflake database. Using Tableau, interactive dashboards are built to analyze real-time data.

### Technologies Used:

- AWS Lambda
- AWS S3
- Snowflake
- Tableau

### Data Extraction:

Utilizing AWS Lambda and the Spotify API, raw data is extracted in JSON format and stored in an AWS S3 Bucket.
Data extraction Lambda functions are automated using AWS CloudWatch on a weekly basis.
Data Transformation:

Extracted raw data from the S3 bucket is transformed to make it suitable for analysis.
A Lambda function is triggered to transform the raw data into three separate datasets: Album Data, Song Data, and Artist Data.

### Data Loading:

Structured data is stored in S3 buckets in three folders: Album Data, Song Data, and Artist Data.
Snowflake stages are used to load data from S3 into Snowflake.

###Â Data Analysis:

Tableau is used for further data analysis.
Data is pulled into Tableau using the Snowflake connector.
Song Data acts as the fact table, while Album Data and Artist Data serve as dimension tables.
Merged datasets are used to create insightful dashboards.


### Business Problem:
A client passionate about the music industry wants to understand the industry better by collecting real-time data to find patterns in trending songs. The client aims to build a recommendation model based on this analysis.

#### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Song Popularity Trends
- Artist Popularity
- Album Release Performance
- User Engagement
- Conversion Rate
- Playlist Effectiveness

#### Machine Learning Ideas:
- Song Recommendation System
- Artist Similarity Analysis
- Predictive Modeling for Song Popularity
- Churn Prediction
- Genre Classification

#### Business Intelligence Ideas:
- Market Analysis
- Competitor Analysis
- User Segmentation
- Content Licensing Optimization
- Marketing Campaign Effectiveness

#### Objectives:
The client aims to update a playlist throughout the year on a weekly basis to collect real-time data on top global songs on Spotify. The collected data will be used to build insights and data-driven solutions over the course of one year.

### Technical Architecture of ETL Pipeline:


#### Data Extraction:
Utilizes AWS Lambda and Spotify API to extract raw data.
Raw data is stored in JSON format in an AWS S3 Bucket.

### Data Transformation:
Extracted raw data is transformed into three separate datasets: Album Data, Song Data, and Artist Data.
Transformation is automated using Lambda functions triggered on a schedule.


### Data Loading:
Structured data is stored in S3 buckets.
Snowflake stages are used to load data from S3 into Snowflake.
Data Analysis:
Tableau is used for further data analysis.
Snowflake connector is used to pull data into Tableau.
Dashboards are created using merged datasets.
